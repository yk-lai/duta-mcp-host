"""geneco-mcp: an MCP server hosting Geneco's D365-backed tools (account
inquiry / create case / case inquiry) and custom-API-backed tools (fee
waiver, re-contract eligibility, fee reversal, password reset) for the
duta-ilmu orchestrator's MCP client to consume.

This service owns the MCP *protocol* surface (``protocol/router.py``) and
its own D365 connector + custom API client, each with its own encrypted
credential storage (``store/``, ``security/``, ``clients/``) — it talks to
D365 and the custom API directly, with no dependency on duta-ilmu's
integration-hub.
